# Texture

In the shading project, it used constant color vctors. But the real objects has its own texture. So, it should use texture colors at each pixel on the 3D object. In this case, it uses (u,v) coordination to find colors for the pixels. Therefore, it should find perspective (u,v) coordination corresponding coordination of 3D object. This example uses image texture and noise pattern which is generated by dynamically. This example generates wolf noise pattern.

## Datasets
### Input

The input file named rects contains rectangles information. Each line is consisted of seven numbers. The first two numbers represent top left corner cordination (X,Y) of rectangle, following two numbers mean bottom right corner cordination (x,y) of rectangle, and following three numbers are the RGB color values. The media contents consist of series of image files. Each image file is .RGB where the resolution is 352x288 containing 352x288 red bytes, followed by 352x288 green bytes, floowed by 352x288 blue bytes.

### Output

The output file is .PPM file format which has an ascii header followed by 8-bit binary pixel color values in raster order (top-left to bottom-right). For example the header is `P6 255 256 255\n` `RGBRGBRGB...` produces a 256x256 image.
